# JKCrystal

This is a hack of Pokémon Crystal.

This hack is centered around the idea of how the game would look if it wasn't geared towards 
children. Essentially, what if all the people in Pokémon Crystal were smart.

## Planned Changes

- All Pokémon stats updated to generation 7
- All available items are updated to generation 7
- Field moves are usable even if a Pokémon doesn't know it
- Physical-Special split
- All bugs in Pokémon Crystal are fixed
- Trainer AI is massively improved
- All unfair advantages for the player are removed
- Boss trainers have loss text
- All Pokémon egg moves updated to generation 7

## Far-off Changes

- All NPC dialogue changed
- Added event scenes
- All Maps updated to HGSS
- All Pokémon sprites changed to SourCrystal versions
- NPC sprites updated if available

## On the Fence

- All trainer and wild Pokémon levels multiplied by 1.25, rounded down
- remove some baby and legendary Pokémon to include generation 4 evolutions
